00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.340
Let's take a look at the 4th platform preview of IE10

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.983
running on the Windows 8 Developer Preview

00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:10.226
With more support for HTML5 technology

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.298
to enable richer applications with improved performance. 

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:18.101
IE 10 adds support for Cross Resource Share, or CORS

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:23.480
 for safely sharing and moving data across domains using XMLHttpRequests.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.079
This demo uses CORS along with fileAPI, drag drop support, and  an HTML5 progress control

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.048
styled with CSS for a fast and fluid experience uploading multiple files. 

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:37.441
The web app is running in one domain, and 

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.252
the files are uploaded to another domain for storage

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:46.124
You can drag files from the local machine and drop them to upload, 

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:48.602
and see visual feedback indicating the progress.

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:56.274
Lets look at an example of improved performance in this platform preview.

00:00:56.274 --> 00:01:00.635
This demo brings together HTML5 Canvas, gradients and opacity, 

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:03.520
with SVG rendering and touch interaction. 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.622
Here, each falling rain drop is a separate div tag, animated with CSS3 transforms.  

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:13.167
The improved layout performance, and hardware acceleration in IE10

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:20.351
enables fast rendering and a steady 60 frames per second. 

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.939
Let's look at this demo in another browser. 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.178
Here, in the lastest version of Chrome, you have the same demo

00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:28.789
running the same markup

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:37.017
but you're only getting 3 or for frames per second in rendering performance

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:43.269
Next, let's look at new CSS support for controlling end user selection.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.349
With CSS User Select, developers can control precisely which 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.663
parts of their app can be selected.

00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:53.518
Without User Select, all parts of the page can be selected by the user. 

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:58.484
Developers can specify User Select in CSS rules to control the selection.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:04.025
Here, only text in the edit box can be selected. 

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:09.146
This improves the experience by keeping app UI separate from the content. 

00:02:09.146 --> 00:02:11.443
Let's look at one more demo. 

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:16.143
Making web content accessible to all consumers is important

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:20.954
IE10 adds new support for text captions with HTML5 video

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:24.868
In this demo you can see how IE10 support for the HTML5 track element

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:29.450
Enables rendering text captions that are synchronized with the contents of the video. 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.758
Because caption files are just text and time stamps,

00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:37.508
you can search the captions, and even click to jump to a specific point in the video.

00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:43.309
IE10 is the first browser with track captioning and support 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.249
for TTML and WebVTT formats

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:52.318
Developers can choose which format works best for their needs. 

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:55.494
With this latest Platform Preview, IE10 continues to deliver 

00:02:55.494 --> 00:03:00.991
the foundational features and performance developers depend on to build great applications.

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:04.863
